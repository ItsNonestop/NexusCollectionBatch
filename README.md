# NexusCollectionBatch
Trying to download collections/modpacks on nexusmods is a pain as a free user, especially for larger collections, NexusCollectionBatch aims to provide an easier way to download mods within a collection, automating the download process to save hassle and time

I made this tool to save myself time when downloading modpacks, I have only tested functionality currently on Brave Browser
